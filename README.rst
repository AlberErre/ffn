ffn - a financial function library for Python.

Alpha software - use at your own risk!


Installation
------------

To install ffn, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ pip install ffn

If pip is not installed, I recommend installing the `Anaconda Scientific Python
Distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_. This distribution comes with many of the required packages pre-installed, including pip. Once Anaconda is installed, the above command should complete the installation. 

ffn should be compatible with Python 2.7.
