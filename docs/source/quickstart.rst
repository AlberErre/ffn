Quickstart
==========

First things first, we must install ffn. ffn stands on the shoulders of giants
and therefore has many requirements. The easiest way to get started is to
install the `Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_. 
This distribution comes with many of the required packages pre-installed, including pip. 

To install ffn, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ pip install ffn

Now let's get started. By the way, We are using an IPython Notebook for our example. If you don't know what
that is, you definitely need to check it out `here <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`__!
